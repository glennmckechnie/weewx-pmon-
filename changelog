0.5.3 March 2018
* modifications to mwalls existing pmon by Glenn McKechie
 https://github.com/glennmckechnie
* renamed to pmon+ purely to prevent clashes with the existing pmon
 extension. The databases are incompatable.
* change process selection (weewxd) to use os.getpid() (PID) to enable usage
 with multiple weewx instances. Run this extension within each weewx instance
 , change the HTML_ROOT = /var/www/html/weewx/pmon entry in the [stdReport]
 section of weewx.conf to seperate report output.
* remove process = weewxd from weewx.conf. pmon+ will only ever track weewxd,
 - see point directly above. There is no longer an option to change it so
 removal is to prevent possible confusion. If you wish to track other
 process's use the original pmon.
* modify code to use swap and mem values from /proc/meminfo,
 Code used was sourced from the cmon extension by mwall.
* add res_rss column to database to allow storage of python-resource max rss
 values for comparison to original mem_* values or debugging values, if the
 user includes such code elsewhere?
* option to store values in the database as MB (this is a workaround to
 fix the image labelling for y axis when there are too many zeros - think GBs)
* database changed to floating point to allow expression of smaller values (KB).
* display $latest.tag-value as weewx tags for inclusion in index.html.tmpl
* reworked __main__ to run as stand alone.
